# Sources Suitable for Adhyayana (Traditional Study)

## Critical Requirements
- **NO metric restoration** or academic "corrections"
- **Traditional text** as preserved in oral tradition
- **Authentic svara** as actually recited
- **Both pada and saṃhitā** from living tradition

## AVOID These Academic Sources
❌ **GRETIL** - Often has "restored" texts
❌ **TITUS** - May include metric corrections
❌ **Critical editions** - Composite texts not from any real tradition
❌ **Reconstructed texts** - Academic exercises, not for recitation

## GOOD Sources for Adhyayana

### 1. **Traditional Pāṭhaśālā Publications**
- **Sringeri Sharada Peetham** publications
- **Kanchi Kamakoti Peetham** texts
- **Regional Veda Pāṭhaśālā** publications
- These preserve texts as actually recited

### 2. **Government Traditional Text Projects**
- **Rashtriya Veda Vidya Pratishthan** (vedavid.gov.in)
- **Vedic Heritage Portal** - when from traditional sources
- Focus on preserving living traditions

### 3. **Traditional Publisher Texts**
- **Vaidika Samshodhana Mandala, Pune**
- **Samskrita Bharati** traditional texts
- **Regional traditional publishers** (often in Kannada, Telugu, Tamil script)

### 4. **Verified Traditional Digital Collections**
- **Vedamu.org** - Traditional Telugu preservation
- **Vaidika Vignanam** - Traditional texts
- **Sri Vaishnava** collections (for relevant texts)

### 5. **Direct Recordings/Transcriptions**
- Direct transcriptions from **traditional reciters**
- **Audio-aligned texts** from pāṭhaśālās
- Community-preserved traditions

## What Makes a Source Adhyayana-Suitable?

### ✅ GOOD Signs:
- Mentions specific **śākhā** and **regional tradition**
- Credits traditional **guru paramparā**
- Includes **traditional svara markings** (not academic notation)
- Has **both pada and saṃhitā** from same tradition
- Used in actual **pāṭhaśālās**

### ❌ BAD Signs:
- Terms like "critical edition", "restored", "corrected"
- Multiple manuscript variants listed
- Academic footnotes about "original" readings
- Composite from multiple sources
- "Standardized" or "normalized" text

## Practical Approach for Udapaana

### 1. **Use What You Have**
Your Taittirīya DOCX collection is ideal - it's from traditional sources

### 2. **Carefully Vet New Sources**
For each potential source, check:
- Is this from a living recitation tradition?
- Is this what's actually taught in pāṭhaśālās?
- Are the svara marks traditional (not academic)?

### 3. **Traditional Community Connections**
Best sources often come through:
- Direct contact with pāṭhaśālās
- Traditional teacher networks
- Community preservation projects

### 4. **Regional Variations Are Good**
- Āndhra tradition Taittirīya
- Drāviḍa tradition Taittirīya
- Mahārāṣṭra tradition variations
These are all valid - not "errors" to be corrected

## Recommended Data Structure
```

│   ├── rigveda_maharashtra/   # If available
│   └── metadata.json          # Source: X Pāṭhaśālā, Y tradition

## Warning About Sanskrit Documents & Others

Even sanskritdocuments.org needs careful checking:
- Some texts are traditional ✅
- Some are academic editions ❌
- Need to check each text's source

## Key Principle
**If it's not recited this way in a pāṭhaśālā somewhere, it doesn't belong in Udapaana.**
